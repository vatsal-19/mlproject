# Student Performance Prediction Project

## Overview
This project aims to predict student performance using machine learning techniques. It includes a modular project structure for scalability and code organization.

## Features
- Data preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared student performance data for analysis.
- Model development: Utilized regression and classification models to predict student outcomes.
- Model evaluation: Evaluated model performance using appropriate metrics.
- Deployment: Deployed the machine learning model using cloud services for accessibility and scalability.
